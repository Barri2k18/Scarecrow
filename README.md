# Scarecrow

Scarecrow is a bot I made for friends and their servers, it has a cool twitter stream feature and some additional fun and eventually useful commands.

## Usage

Invite the bot to your server using [this link][bot invite], then perform commands using the bot's mention as the commands' prefix, e.g :

```
@Scarecrow#8745 info
@Scarecrow#8745 prefix add €
€twitter search discord
€twitter follow discordapp
```

Note that commands altering the bot's behavior usually require the user to have the ``Manage Server`` permission.

### The help command
The `help` command is the best way to know what the bot or a command does.

Typing `@Scarecrow#8745 help` will display the available commands (not everyone can run every command, see previous paragraph) as a list with a short description explaining their main purpose.

For detailed info about a command named `foo`, type `@Scarecrow#8745 help foo`. e.g :

```
@Scarecrow#8745 help
@Scarecrow#8745 help poll
@Scarecrow#8745 help twitter fetch
```

## Support
