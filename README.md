Scarecrow
=========

Scarecrow is a bot I made for friends and their servers, it has a cool twitter stream feature and some additional fun and eventually useful commands.

## Usage

Invite the bot to your server using [this link][bot invite], then perform commands using the bot's mention as the commands' prefix, e.g :

```
@Scarecrow#8745 prefix add â‚¬
@Scarecrow#8745 twitter follow discordapp
```

The help command will display the available commands list or information about the category or specific command you give it :

```
@Scarecrow#8745 help
@Scarecrow#8745 help Misc
@Scarecrow#8745 help twitter fetch
```

Note that commands altering the bot's behavior usually require the user to have the ``Manage Server`` permission.
